Quoridor is a project that I completed in RIT CS2 Data structures as a part of a two man team. Our objective was to program a computer to play the board game quoridor and be able to beat the given opponents 9 times out of 10. This project involved the analysis of time complexities and search algorithms because we were required to choose our next move under a time limit.

The major challenge of this project was figuring out an intelligent way to choose our next move while keeping the amount of time the choosing process takes to a minimum. We used a breadth first search in order to find the pawns shortest path to the goal, and then chose our move based on that.
