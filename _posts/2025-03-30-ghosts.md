I think the haunted often gets things backwards. It is not the ghosts who are stuck here on this earth with something left to resolve. Ghosts are not developmental. They are trapped photographs of people. It is only us, the left behind, who can change. Only the living can grow, can learn to release the ghosts. We are not haunted by ghosts. We haunt the ghosts
