ToolShare is a community tool sharing website that I created as a part of a team during SWEN 261 Introduction to Software Engineering. My role on the team was head Programmer, so a majority of the programming and html/css work was done by me. <br>
<br>
The main goal of the website was to allow community members to sign on and share tools with other members of their community. A community shed could be created, given a location, and then community members could add/remove their tools from the shed or borrow other peoples tools from the shed. The site also allowed for users to reserve tools for future use, so that if they knew they would need a tool some time in the future it would be available.<br>
