My Life Is Nerdy, or MLIN, was a website created for nerdy people to post nerdy stories about their lives, and for others to read and enjoy these stories. The website allowed anyone to submit a story, but before they were posted on the main website they were reviewed and approved by other members of the site.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the site is no longer available as the free hosting that was being used went down, but in 2012 during the websites prime there was an active member base of 2000 users.<br>
<br>
The site was designed in HTML and Javascript using jQuery and had a backed of PHP using MySQL.<br>
