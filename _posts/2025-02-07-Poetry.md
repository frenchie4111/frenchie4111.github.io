I'm thinking about turning these poems into like a little interactive book, so you can see them like on a page rather than in a long list like this

It could be cool idk

## 2/25

I had one of those long dreadful dreams last night
We were in some Asian country with a bunch of half friends
We danced in orange light

I already know how today is going to go
Honestly I already know how this week is going to go
The cycles are becoming clearer to me
And somehow that makes it harder to get out of bed

Do you ever think about how damaging this thing was
And how we did it to ourselves
Fuck

And like a playlist the memories run through me
In perfect reliable order
The glee, the park, the beach
We’re laying in some anonymous sunbeam
Time seems to have stopped in Cleveland
I’m certain now of how I feel about you
_i need to write the rest of this_

Scholars still wonder why it was so cathartic

## 1/25

And slowly you start to listen to the old songs
And they start to make sense again
And just for a moment it’s not so scary
And you take one step
And then another

And then he wonders. What does letting go really mean?
I don’t know, for once, I’m not quite sure

the nice thing about falling down is that sometimes, just for a second, you can pretend it’s the bottom

i’m so sorry that I need you

I'm not used to needing people. I was born to a strong smart independent, probably should but can't ask for help, mother. I lost my father early. The universe taught me dreadfully young that I was alone out here. That needing people would only end in tragedy.
Some people say we are destined to write the same stories over and over again. I think maybe sometimes we write the same ending because it's the only one we understand. Or maybe sometimes it's just to prove ourselves right. I can only connect with people who I know will ultimately leave me, because that proves that people I let in always leave.

i often wonder what it is you thought I didn’t know about you

"It's not like this with other people" - Marianne

## 10/24

It sort of felt like that moment when your subway car is perfectly lined up with the next door, and you smile at a girl, and she smiles back. You’ll never forget her

i’m so tired of breaking promises because of you that i’ve just stopped making them

my new neighborhood is full of jeep cherokees
almost every other car like yours
i can move thousands of miles away
but the ghosts will follow

i feel like getting drunk so i can justify calling you

I pushed the feeling out of my heart and onto my limbs. For a while it was a break, I no longer felt you everywhere I went. But, after a while I realized that instead of feeling the longing, I had become it.

nothing like the quiet bathroom of a bar you don’t want to be in
staring at your phone wondering how the hell you ended up here
i remember watching you find the void while sitting on the toilet
god damnit i miss you

## 9/24

Feel better soon
Desperately trying to
There’s a third line to this poem

## 6/24

My car is back home
Collecting residential parking tickets
Even the temporary permit has expired

i've tried to write about the spring leaves
they way they hold on
barely clinging to the big branch that brought them
earnestly absorbing, not a care in the world
if only we could live lives like that
attached to our branch, leaves destined to fall
i want to hold on next to you
i want the sun to suck us dry again
on the beach in the sun on the ground
there's nothing left for me but that
just the sun. just the water.

On one hand
The only way out is through
On the other
Through is always the way out

the leaves are still left on their trees
i wonder when they will fall

the world keeps spinning
so grab on, hold tight, watch out
remember beauty

my toxic bedroom
open the curtains see the sun
get up stupid
don't die hungry

we are addicts
we never forget the urge
we live besides it

she sells sea shells by the sea shore
somewhat stalking she seems so
for sure she'll see this shortly

don’t worry son
something softer
this way comes

## 5/24

Maybe if I push myself just a little harder I will forget you
Maybe if I push myself just a little harder I will forget you
Maybe if I push myself just a little harder I will forget you
Maybe if I push myself just a little harder I will forget you
Maybe if I push myself just a little harder I will forget you
Maybe if I push myself just a little harder I will forget you

## 4/24

still sleeping on the couch next to the ghost of us

## 3/24

a life borrowed
repaid in grief

and so we wait
side by side but far apart
a tale of two souls
who didn’t know they were lost
until they found each other

## 2/24

I still wish for you on every eyelash

seeking calmer days
a moment's rest is broken
by skull kid girl

## 11/23

slowly slipping away
i’m begging it to stay but
I need it to go

## 10/23

I worry for a second that we might not make it. I look up, we smile, and I realize how dumb that thought was.

warm midday slumber party
it feels like we could spend an eternity
just being us

almost done
or maybe not
whatever

if my life was a McDonalds order, I'd defintely order a small fry with it

it would be an honor to be woken up by your midnight stirrings

I can't tell which one is the waiting
when I am without you
or when I am with you

the world keeps spinning
the closer we are
the slower it gets

## 9/23

The first time I met you I forgot how to imagine my life without you in it

bar lit lip biting
our thick personal fog
didn’t we just meet

first a blanket
then a crack
then nothing at all

## 6/23

Like the leaves and the wind. We need each other but we aren’t sure why.

All these books, but all I want to read is the story of us

My heart is full of holes
one the shape of you
cut into an unperfect whole
the empty space just as
meaninful as what remains
i wonder each time
what will convince me to
let the next person take
their piece
Remember we are not just
what is left but also what
we have lost. We don't
exist only within ourselves
but inside the ones who love
the pieces we gave them

Not many people have really seen me. There’s not many who would care if I stopped, if I changed, if I didn’t try as hard, if I stopped loving this way, if my fire went out. You are one of the few who saw me for who I am. Who looked through and let me let you see the brilliance I hold in side. The parts of me I keep to myself because I know they’d use them against me. The confused, scary, loving, fearful, anxious and beautiful parts. I am scared that I lost you because I know what parts of me you take with you. I’m scared that I lost you because I know what parts of you I take with me. I’m scared that I lost you

Swimming without you I can remember how it felt
Watching you try not to drink the salt water
Listening to you ask me to marry you
Water land is no fun on your own

The air is so thick I can feel it on my skin
Unfortunately that reminds me of you
The water is so cool but I am alone in it
The water reminds me of you
The wind in the trees sounds like your breath on my ear
The cars on the street hold the smiles of happy couples holding hands
Unfortunately they remind me of you
I can’t stop reading a book I know you’ll love
Unfortunately that reminds me of you
My hands feel empty my heart so fucking heavy
Unfortunately that reminds me of you

## 5/23

though it's quiet out
i hear your voice on the wind
always

she was the waves and i was the beach

parking next to me
metaphorically and literally
waiting for you to come back

pretending not to care
but i can still smell you

she's something lovely
it's so bright outside
despite the gloom

## 3/23

pull back the haze
make me who I want to be
not who I am

I’ll be asleep before the food gets here
Never done this first time for it
She hums while we wait for it to pass through
Its just the life we live not fair

lately I been feeling like a middle child
forced to be creative for attention

metaphorically
me ta phor ic al ly


## 2/23

maybe not forever
but definitely today
as long as possible

## 1/23

Marry me, marry me
We’ll buy a house in the country
With a porch 3 kids and a dog
We will sell furniture, yarn
And maybe video blog about it
from everything I know about you
and everything I will learn
you’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever met
have a happy 27th year
happy birthday
love Mike

maybe not forever
but definitely today
as long as possible

You know this already
My heart is yours to break
Godamnit Yankee

## 12/2022

Well I don’t really know what to say
I’ve only really known you for 3 months
But it’s felt like so much longer

## 10/2022

midnights, cigarettes
awful ideas behind brown eyes
godamnit yankee

midnights, cigarettes
stupid jokes with new friends
drinking with yankee

brown eyes, big smile
pizza
desperate for more

## 9/2022

morning cold
burning into
warmer days

complex headaches
relive last night slowly
the joyful coaster

## 8/2022

do i want to know
drunk me avoiding drunk you
crave quiet places

another drunk text
not sure i will ever learn
crave quiet places

can help but hear it
space between your sentences
crave quiet places

## Before that

could talk forever
maybe someday we’ll run out
then what

bent never broken
goodnight sleep well i love you
everyday always

fallen but we grew
i really love you for life
seven years always
