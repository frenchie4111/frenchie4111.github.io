In an attempt to make this site look prettier I have added HTML code blocks. The library that I am using to do this is called highlight_js-rails. It was easily added to my rails project by just adding gem &apos;highlight_js-rails&apos; to my Gemfile. Here is an example of it in action:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf(&quot;Hello World\n&quot;);
}
</stdio.h></code></pre><br>
<br>
This is my application.css:<br>
<pre><code>/*
*= require_self
 *= require highlight_js/monokai
*/
</code></pre><br>
<br>
And my application.js:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require highlight_js/highlight
//= require highlight_js/languages/ruby
//= require highlight_js/languages/cpp
//= require highlight_js/languages/python
//= require highlight_js/languages/javascript
</code></pre><br><br>
