During my time on the FIRST Robotics team 1111, the Powerhawks I developed the website http://www.Powerhawks.org/ with one other person on the website team. The website is designed in HTML and Javascript (using jquery). The backend of the website is a custom CMS programmed in PHP and mySQL that allows other users to easily edit different parts of the website.<br>
<br>
The backend CMS allowed for non-technical users to edit pages with a what you see is what you get editor, and easily publish content to the site. The site featured heavy javascript styling, and won the 2011 FIRST Robotics Website excellence award.<br>
