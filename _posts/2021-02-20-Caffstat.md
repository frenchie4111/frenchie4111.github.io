I've posted several previous blog posts journaling the progress of this project, check out those posts here: [here](/2020/12/27/Building-my-own-HomeKit-Thermostat-v1.html)

## Features

Key features include:

 - Display and buttons allow operation like a normal thermostat
 - Comes with pre-built integrations with Home Assistant, HomeKit, Google Home
 - Open sourced code & easily programmable via micro uSB
 - 3 Relays for controlling: Fan, Heating & Cooling systems

## Limitations

For the beta version, the product will still have a few limitations:

 - Beta version of the software. Will require frequent updates using USB & Command line
 - USB Power only! 10ft flat white usb cable will be included for powering

## Buy one

The Beta version ships in early 2021, I am only selling a few of these boards as a
test run, so get your order in quick if you are interested.
