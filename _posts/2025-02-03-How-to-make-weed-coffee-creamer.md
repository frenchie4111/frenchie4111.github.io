<b>Steps</b>
<ol>1. Decarb your Weed
    <ol>a. Dump about one full grinders worth of Weed onto a flat surface</ol>
    <ol>b. Put in Oven</ol>
    <ol>c. Turn Oven to ~300¬∫</ol>
    <ol>d. Leave in oven until you can really smell it in your apartment and are starting to worry that your neighbors might also smell it</ol>
</ol>
<ol>2. Go back to the store because the first heavy cream you bought had gone bad already</ol>
<ol>3. Mix Weed & Heavy Cream over a low heat
    <ol>a. Put Heavy Cream into a sauce pan</ol>
    <ol>b. Turn stove on VERY LOW</ol>
    <ol>c. Mix Weed into cream</ol>
    <ol>d. (optional) Mix a bit of flour in to the cream to help it not curdle</ol>
    <ol>e. Stir as often as you remember</ol>
    <ol>f. Leave this until it starts to smell like popcorn in your office (if it smells like burnt popcorn you have gone too far)</ol>
