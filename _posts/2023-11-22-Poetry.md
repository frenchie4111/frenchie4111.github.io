## 3/24

a life borrowed
repaid in grief

and so we wait
side by side but far apart
a tale of two souls
who didn’t know they were lost
until they found each other

## 2/24

I still wish for you on every eyelash

seeking calmer days
a moment's rest is broken
by skull kid girl

## 11/23

slowly slipping away
i’m begging it to stay but
I need it to go

## 10/23

I worry for a second that we might not make it. I look up, we smile, and I realize how dumb that thought was.

warm midday slumber party
it feels like we could spend an eternity
just being us

almost done
or maybe not
whatever

if my life was a McDonalds order, I'd defintely order a small fry with it

it would be an honor to be woken up by your midnight stirrings

I can't tell which one is the waiting
when I am without you
or when I am with you

the world keeps spinning
the closer we are
the slower it gets

## 9/23

The first time I met you I forgot how to imagine my life without you in it

bar lit lip biting
our thick personal fog
didn’t we just meet

first a blanket
then a crack
then nothing at all

## 6/23

Like the leaves and the wind. We need each other but we aren’t sure why.

All these books, but all I want to read is the story of us

My heart is full of holes
one the shape of you
cut into an unperfect whole
the empty space just as
meaninful as what remains
i wonder each time
what will convince me to
let the next person take
their piece
Remember we are not just
what is left but also what
we have lost. We don't
exist only within ourselves
but inside the ones who love
the pieces we gave them

Not many people have really seen me. There’s not many who would care if I stopped, if I changed, if I didn’t try as hard, if I stopped loving this way, if my fire went out. You are one of the few who saw me for who I am. Who looked through and let me let you see the brilliance I hold in side. The parts of me I keep to myself because I know they’d use them against me. The confused, scary, loving, fearful, anxious and beautiful parts. I am scared that I lost you because I know what parts of me you take with you. I’m scared that I lost you because I know what parts of you I take with me. I’m scared that I lost you

Swimming without you I can remember how it felt
Watching you try not to drink the salt water
Listening to you ask me to marry you
Water land is no fun on your own

The air is so thick I can feel it on my skin
Unfortunately that reminds me of you
The water is so cool but I am alone in it
The water reminds me of you
The wind in the trees sounds like your breath on my ear
The cars on the street hold the smiles of happy couples holding hands
Unfortunately they remind me of you
I can’t stop reading a book I know you’ll love
Unfortunately that reminds me of you
My hands feel empty my heart so fucking heavy
Unfortunately that reminds me of you

## 5/23

though it's quiet out
i hear your voice on the wind
always

she was the waves and i was the beach

parking next to me
metaphorically and literally
waiting for you to come back

pretending not to care
but i can still smell you

she's something lovely
it's so bright outside
despite the gloom

## 3/23

pull back the haze
make me who I want to be
not who I am

I’ll be asleep before the food gets here
Never done this first time for it
She hums while we wait for it to pass through
Its just the life we live not fair

lately I been feeling like a middle child
forced to be creative for attention

metaphorically
me ta phor ic al ly


## 2/23

maybe not forever
but definitely today
as long as possible

## 1/23

Marry me, marry me
We’ll buy a house in the country
With a porch 3 kids and a dog
We will sell furniture, yarn
And maybe video blog about it
from everything I know about you
and everything I will learn
you’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever met
have a happy 27th year
happy birthday
love Mike

maybe not forever
but definitely today
as long as possible

You know this already
My heart is yours to break
Godamnit Yankee

## 12/2022

Well I don’t really know what to say
I’ve only really known you for 3 months
But it’s felt like so much longer

## 10/2022

midnights, cigarettes
awful ideas behind brown eyes
godamnit yankee

midnights, cigarettes
stupid jokes with new friends
drinking with yankee

brown eyes, big smile
pizza
desperate for more

## 9/2022

morning cold
burning into
warmer days

complex headaches
relive last night slowly
the joyful coaster

## 8/2022

do i want to know
drunk me avoiding drunk you
crave quiet places

another drunk text
not sure i will ever learn
crave quiet places

can help but hear it
space between your sentences
crave quiet places

## Before that

could talk forever
maybe someday we’ll run out
then what

bent never broken
goodnight sleep well i love you
everyday always

fallen but we grew
i really love you for life
seven years always
