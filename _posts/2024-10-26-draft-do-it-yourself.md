The honest truth of it is that you are alone. Nobody is going to help you, well we will try, but ultimately we can't. If you want something done you WILL have to do it yourself. Or at the very least you will have to be responsible for it.

Development driven development is about never being blocked, and a core tenant of not being blocked is that you are going to have to do it yourself. If you care about something then ultimately it's your job to make sure it gets done. If you want the audio on your product to sound good, you are going to have to make it sound good. If you want to sober up and get over her, you are going to have to do it yourself. She can't help you, your friends can't, your therapists can't you. It's your job to get it done. The person who cares the most is ultimately responsible for solving the problem. You should care so much about what you are doing that you are the last person who quits.

It's not that they don't want to help you. It's that they literally can't. At the end of the day if you care more than them about the outcome, then you are going to end up responsible for it.

To be clear I am not saying that you shouldn't seek help in achieving your goals. Help is obviously extremely important. I am just trying to point out the reality that even if you get someone to help you do something, you can never relinquish your responsibility to them that it gets done. If you have someone on your team who is building the app, they share the responsibility for the app working well, but they never fully take the responsibility from you.

I'll give you an example. I am an addict. Most recently I was addicted to a person. The thing I have found the hardest about dealing with addiction is the feeling of hopelessness. It takes over your brain and convinces you that you are powerless to resist. You are not powerless. In fact, the only person with power is you. You are the only thing you have control over. If you want something done, you have to do it yourself. Don't just sit there, start at the beginning, then do the second thing, and keep doing things until it's finished.

Anyways happy 2 years, I love you, good luck
