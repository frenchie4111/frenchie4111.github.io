Squares Launcher is a launcher that was inspired by the new Windows phone operating system. It provides you with all your important information on the home screen, while allowing easy access to all of your apps in a side drawer. Applications and widgets can be added to the home screen in arbitrary counts/sizes, this allows for maximum user customization.<br>

Squares was originally currently available on the Google Play store for only 1$, and sold a few thousand copies.
