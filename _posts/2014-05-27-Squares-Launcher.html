Squares Launcher is a launcher that was inspired by the new Windows phone operating system. It provides you with all your important information on the home screen, while allowing easy access to all of your apps in a side drawer. Applications and widgets can be added to the home screen in arbitrary counts/sizes, this allows for maximum user customization.<br>
<br>
The major challenges while creating this app were quickly loading the home screen on demand while still keeping up to date on what Apps the user had installed. To do this most of the processing is happening in numerous separate threads <br>
