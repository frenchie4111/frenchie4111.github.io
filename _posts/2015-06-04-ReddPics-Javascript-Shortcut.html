I have created a bookmarklet that takes you from reddit.com/r/whatever to reddpics.com/r/whatever. Here is the very simple code that you can paste in the browser:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>javascript:document.location=((window.location+&quot;&quot;).replace(window.location.hostname, &quot;reddpics.com&quot;))
</code></pre>
<br>
And if you drag this into your bookmarks bar you can use it any time: <a href="javascript:(function()%7Bjavascript%3Adocument.location%3D((window.location%2B%22%22).replace(window.location.hostname%2C%20%22reddpics.com%22))%7D)()">Auto ReddPics</a>
