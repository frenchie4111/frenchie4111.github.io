## What, huh, why?

Recently I have been really interested in learning about different types of
mechanical manufacturing technologies, and I realized that silicone moulding is
actually super easy to get started with at home. So, like I often do, I started
looking for a project to justify learning/buying a bunch of new stuff.

Silicone mould making trial kits:

 - Mould material: [Smooth-On Oomoo 30 Trial Kit $30 bucks](https://amzn.to/2ThdJD1)
 - Resin material: [Smooth-On Smooth-Cast 300 Trial Kit $23 bucks](https://amzn.to/2MzU3I1)

At my company, we are having a launch party for our latest generation of sensor,
and I thought it would be super cool to celebrate by giving all my co-workers mini
versions of the new product for their fridge.

## Modeling and Printing the Master

Before making the molds, I needed to get a 3d printed "master" made at the dimensions
that I wanted to make the minis. The original sensor model contains a lot of really
complex curves that I didn't want to re-create from scratch, so instead I used
a few boolean operations, starting from the original sensor to create a 45% scale
solid version.

Started here:

Subtracted that from a big block to get a negative:

Subtracted again to get a solid version, and manually added back in some detail
on the bottom of the sensor:

Printed a couple different versions to see what size I wanted:

In order to get the highest possible quality master print, I sent away for it
from [Hubs](https://www.hubs.com/) to get printed on an SLA style 3d printer with 25Î¼m
layers heights. 3 days later my print arrived in the mail, you can barely make
out the layers on this thing.

## Making some molds

Next step is to make a few silicone moulds. Since this is the cheaper type of
silicone, tin based, each mold should last for about 10-15 castings before
starting to break down. Since I want to end up with about 30 of these, I decided
to make 3 molds.

Making a mold is pretty simple, just make a box out of some hot glue and foam-core,
hotglue the master to the bottom, and pour the mixed silicone in overtop.

I had a few issues with bubbles getting trapped in the the smaller details
on the bottom of the sensor. To help with this I would pour very fine strands
of the silicone into the bottom, and jostle it into the details of the master
before pouring the rest of the mold.

## Making a lot of Minis

Now it was just a matter of buying 2 gallon jugs of white Smooth-Cast 300 resin
from my local craft shop, and making 30 of these things. The resin cures in
about 10 minutes, so a few evenings of work later and I had 40

After sanding down some of the casting imperfections, giving them all a
few clear coats of matte spray paint for protection, and sticking a magnet
on, they were done and ready for the party.

I was able to figure this out thanks to some great free resources on the internet. I
