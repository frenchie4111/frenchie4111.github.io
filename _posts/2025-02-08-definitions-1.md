okay i've decided to start writing out my definitions of things so that we can all be on the same page going forward.

to be clear: __I believe that a shared definition is significantly more important than having a correct definition.__ To this end, these are not intended to be anything more than very well defined and specific starting points that we can define for these specific words. This will make more sense once you start reading them.



# Definition 1: Love

Recently I wrote:

Which to me defined a very clear base definition for love. Not just romantic love, but all love. I think to love someone is to allow them to change you. It's saying: I trust you enough that I will become a different person because of you. I trust that you will push me into a direction that I want to go.

To me this is a clear definition because it seems to capture all of the ways that I love people in my life.

Some kinds of love are familial. Family love is saying: no matter what, I will bend my life if you need me to. We are placed on this earth with these people, and they are our responsibility forever. (side note: the definition of responsibility is a future topic.) We do whatever it takes, and in that way we love them.

Sometimes love is the trust of a friend. Our friends trust us to help them become better people. The people I am closest with in my life have my best interest at heart. All of your friends want to see you succeed.

Some kinds of love are romantic. I am happy to entangle you in the every day of my life. I would love to sit with you in a dentists office. Drive you to your workout. I don't need to always hang out with you, I have life outside you, but if you need someone to be there with you I am always happy to do it. Also let's get breakfast sometime? I finally went to plow for the first time, and honestly it's overrated.

Sometimes love is sad. I know that we can't be together anymore, right now, or whatever. That's fine with me. The people that I love the most in life I know that even if I didn't talk to them for years, when I needed them they would come back. They trust me to only reach out when I need them. I should not disrespect that trust. Hashtag should i break no contact dot com.

And sometimes we love ourselves. We let the soft animal of our body love what it loves. Find your place in the family of things. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfayiBoaXE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfayiBoaXE8)

I love you, whoever you are. I'll always love you
