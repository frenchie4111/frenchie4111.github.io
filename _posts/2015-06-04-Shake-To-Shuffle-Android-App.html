Shake to shuffle was created by myself and 2 other members of the Serpent Software team for our high school senior capstone project. During the process of creating the application I learned a lot about what it takes to produce a full piece of software under a very strict timeline. I also learned a lot about programming Java for the Android device, as well as mobile development in general.<br>
<br>
This app is a port of the well known functionality of iOS devices to Android. It allows the user to shake the phone in order to skip their music player to the next song.<br>
<br>
We faced many challenges while trying to create this app. Mainly the fact that every music player application has it&apos;s own way of skipping music, and because we wanted this to be a universal application we had to come up with a way that most music applications would accept. Our solution was, we found a way to imitate the hardware button on some commercial headphones that skip the song by sending a certain broadcast to the system. One major problem we ran into was keeping the app active while the phone was asleep, without wasting too much battery.<br>
<br>
My major responsibilities in the creation of this app was keeping the team on task because we had a very strict deadline, as well as documenting every twist and turn we encountered during the development of this app.<br>
