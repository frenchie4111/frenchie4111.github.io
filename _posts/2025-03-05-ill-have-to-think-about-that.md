I'm not so sure what to make of him quite yet. We've just met, but he makes me laugh. He's a bit all over the place though, isn't he? I can't quite tell when he's being serious. He seems to love his family, friends. He plays a lot of rocket league, but he seems to love it. He never steps on cracks. He's got an interesting way of viewing the world. I like listening to the way he talks about it

I'm not so sure what to make of her quite yet. We've just met, but she makes me laugh. She seems to have her shit together. She has a stable job. She is cute when she's angry about something, which happens often. She has strong perspective, lot's of opinions about lots of things. She talks to trees and the ghost of her grandma. She often has to think about things.

I'm beginning to worry he's not that serious about this. He has a very unstable job. He works under a papa johns for christ's sake. He's mentioned trauma but I can't seem to get him to tell me more. I'm sure he's into me. He's definitely cute, if not maybe a bit cheesy. But, something about him worries me. He hasn't asked, we haven't talked about it, I don't know what he's looking for. I'm not sure he's right for me. I don't see how he would fit into my life

I wonder what she thinks of my crazy life. I've joked around the edges of some trauma, but honestly I don't feel like talking about it anymore. I can never quite tell how she feels about something. Sometimes I find out she cared a lot more about something than she let on. I guess she's a bit guarded, but maybe she'll warm up. She hasn't asked, I wonder what she's looking for. When I look in her eyes I get scared because I'm pretty sure she'll break my heart again
