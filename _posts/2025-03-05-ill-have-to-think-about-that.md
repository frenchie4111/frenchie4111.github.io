I'm not so sure what to make of him quite yet. We've just met. He makes me laugh. He's a bit all over the place though, isn't he? I'm beginning to worry he's not that serious about this. He has a very unstable job. He's mentioned trauma but I can't seem to get him to tell me more. I'm sure he's into me. He's definitely cute, if not maybe a bit cheesy. Something about him worries me. He hasn't asked, we haven't talked about it, I don't know what he's looking for

I'm not so sure what to make of her quite yet. We've just met. She makes me laugh. She seems to have her shit together, I wonder what she thinks of my crazy life. I've joked around the edges of some past trauma, but honestly I don't feel like talking about it, I'm over it anyway. She has a stable job. I can never quite tell how she feels about something. She's just a bit guarded, but seems to be warming slowly. She's very cute, she like's my jokes. She hasn't asked, I wonder what she's looking for. I'm ready again, I just want somebody to love me
