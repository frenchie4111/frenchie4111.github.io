I love building products for people with people. My problem is that 90%+ of the people I talk to every day are also engineers, so the only people I know how to build for are other engineers.

I am desperately looking for people outside of the engineering industry who are passionate about anything other than engineering, I'd love to just chat and gain some of your perspective. Maybe we can build something cool together
