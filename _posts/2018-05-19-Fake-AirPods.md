![AirPods Side by Side Comparison](/images/airpods/side_by_side.jpg)

I recently bought AirPods on [Walmart.com](Walmart.com). I would normally only ever
shop on Amazon, but Amazon famously doesn't sell Apple products so I had to look elsewhere.
An independent reseller on Walmart (Xgears) was selling them for a (in hindsight, suspiciously)
much lower price than retail ($135 at the time, down from $160). So I thought I would give
Walmart a try.

5 weeks, 6 emails and 2 tracking numbers later, I finally recieved my "AirPods" from the Walmart seller.
And as you can see, they were not quite what I was expecting. It looks like a surprising amount
of effort went into making the fake "AirPods" passable physical recreations, but I can't even pair
them with my phone so I can't tell you how they compare on the audio side.

Although Walmart.com is trying to sell itself as the new Amazon, it still has a long
way to come, and a lot of lessons to learn before posing any threat.
