Hearsay is an Android Application that was created to help users stay up to date on the latest news. Hearsay allows users to choose from a wide range of news sources and keeps them up to date on their choices. News is pulled from RSS feeds, and whenever there is new stories they are read out loud using Google&apos;s text to speech software. Users can then view the app to see a description of the story, and follow the link to the website where the story was posted.<br>
<br>
Hearsay was designed to be extensible, so that other sources of notifications can be created. Current planned updates are:
<ul class="square_list">
<li><b>Text Message Notifications</b>: Reads text messages aloud when they come in</li>
<li><b>Email Notifications</b>: Reads emails aloud when they come in</li>
<li><b>Custom RSS Notifications</b>: Active notifications from user entered RSS feeds</li>
<li><b>And much more!</b></li>
</ul>
<br>
Hearsay code was developed by me, and assets were created by another Serpent Software team member <a href="http://rch2260.cias.rit.edu/">Renee Hodenfield</a><br>
<br>
