![Photo of a dusty bookshelf](/images/names-in-book-covers-2.png)

Sometimes you have fine days. You go about your business and find a nice groove. Like going on a nice walk in a park at some point you realize you forget you're even in a park. You take another wander through the winds of your life. Just like I taught you

Other days are hard days. You glance over the dusty bookshelf out the window. Right past a book you still haven't read. The one I lent you. I wrote my name in thick black sharpie on the inside cover. Itâ€™s the last thing I gave you. The last time you'll hear my voice
