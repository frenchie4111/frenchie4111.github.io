Sometimes you have fine days. You go about your business and find a nice groove. Like going on a nice walk in a park at some point you realize you forget you're even in a park. You take another wander through the winds of your life

Other days are hard days. You glance out the window and press replay. You look down and notice the dust on the bookshelf. You notice the book you still haven’t read. I lent it to you. My name is in the cover. It’s the last thing I gave you. It might represent be the last time you ever hear my voice in your head. You arere not going to get to wander today
