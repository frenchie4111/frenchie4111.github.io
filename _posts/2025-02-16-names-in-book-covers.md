Sometimes you have fine days. You go about your business and find a nice groove. Like going on a nice walk in a park at some point you realize you totally forgot you were walking in a park. You take another beautiful wander through another day of your life. You and I use to take those wanders. But you manage to forget that today

Other days are hard days. You look out the window and just get smacked in the face with a memory. You look down and notice the dust on the bookshelf. You notice the book you still haven’t read. I lent it to you. My name is in the cover. It’s the last thing I gave you. It might represent be the last time you ever hear my voice in your head
